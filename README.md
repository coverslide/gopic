# gopic

A simple go-based image viewer

A simple app that allows you to walk through a directory of images via your browser while viewing thumbnails.

# TODO
* Handle videos properly from the app. Right now it just gets downloaded.
* Clean up the js code. Might use a bundler.
* Figure out the converting from non-web videos (.3gp,.mov,.avi) and playing them seamlessly.
